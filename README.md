# mekosh - meko (sh)ell

mekosh is a basic shell that can:

- [x] Execute processes.
  - [x] Execute processes in background.
- [x] Redirect input/output streams to a given file.
- [ ] Redirect command outputs to another command.
- [ ] Remind previous commands (by the most recent used).
- [ ] Autocomplete (I dunno how can I achieve this)
